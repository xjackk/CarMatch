## How To Use w/ Github!

If you are making a change and would like to add it to the project.

Once you have made the change...

* `git add -A`

Then..

* `git commit -am "this is my commit message!"`

You can use `git status` to check if your files have been staged!

Once everthing is staged and ready to go, you can push it to the repository!

* `git push origin master`

All done! ~ Now your changes to the project have been pushed up to here online.

### Pulling Down Other Members Changes!

* Before pushing up other changes, you should **pull** down the other changes the other group members have made!

* `git pull origin master`

Then boom... you're up to date!
